## How to use 

- Create a Room from the homepage to access editor interface
- Your recently used room is saved which you can access from [homepage](https://playground-gilt.vercel.app/)

- This project uses `monaco-editor` which provides intellisense for `.js` `.html` `.css` & `.ts` files
- Other files with extensions like `.cpp` `.java` `.py` `.go` can also be used 
- Files pane on the left side can be used adding and deleting files 
- Any change in editor gets saved `temporarily` represented by `green` coloured pallette besides SAVE button
- This prevents loss of data if refreshed or exited without explicitly saving
- You can save `permanently` using SAVE button
- Share it by using the editor link []

#### Terminal

As of now it can execute only `cls` and `date` cmd. More features to be added soon.
